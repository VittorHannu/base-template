> my web works with panels. 
  @/Users/work/Desktop/base-template/.DOCUMENTATION/panel_system_guide.md, i 
  asked ai agent to do it, but i dunno the workflow, an easy non fatiguing 
  workflow. how can i start making my app? can i have subfolder of pannels? more 
  than one pannel fodler for each feature? how will be the workflow and 
  limitations, will i need to have one 
  @/Users/work/Desktop/base-template/app-1-next/src/app/settings/panels.config.ts
    for each subfolder of panels

✦ Of course. I've analyzed the panel_system_guide.md and the existing code to 
  understand the workflow your AI agent created. It's a convention-based system 
  designed to give you app-like navigation. Here’s a breakdown to answer your 
  questions and help you get started.

  How can I start making my app?

  The easiest way to start is to follow the 5-step workflow from the guide. 
  Let's say you want to create a new feature, like a "Dashboard" at the 
  /dashboard URL. You would:

   1. Create the folder: app-1-next/src/app/dashboard/
   2. Create the files inside that folder, just like the guide shows for 
      /reports:
       * page.tsx (your main dashboard content)
       * layout.tsx (to set up the panel system for this feature)
       * panels.config.ts (to register panels for the dashboard)
       * _panels/ (a folder for your panel components)
   3. Code your components: Write the code for your main page and any panels 
      you need, following the examples in the guide.

  Can I have subfolders of panels?

  Yes, you can. You can organize your panels into subfolders inside the _panels
   directory for better organization.

  For example, you could have:
  _panels/charts/BarChartPanel.tsx
  _panels/lists/TopItemsPanel.tsx

  You would just need to adjust the import path in your panels.config.ts file 
  accordingly:

   1 // app/dashboard/panels.config.ts
   2 import React from "react";
   3 
   4 export const panelRegistry = {
   5   "bar-chart": React.lazy(() => import(
     "./_panels/charts/BarChartPanel")),
   6   "top-items": React.lazy(() => import(
     "./_panels/lists/TopItemsPanel")),
   7 };

  More than one panel folder for each feature?

  No. The system is designed to have one `_panels` folder for each feature 
  route. The layout.tsx and panels.config.ts in a feature's directory are 
  specifically linked to the _panels folder inside that same directory.

  What is the workflow and what are the limitations?

  Workflow:
  The workflow is consistent: for any new top-level feature (like /home, 
  /settings, /dashboard), you create the folder and the set of files (page.tsx,
   layout.tsx, panels.config.ts, _panels/). This creates a new "stack" of 
  panels for that feature.

  Limitations:
   * No Direct URLs: Panels are "pseudo-pages" and don't have their own URLs. 
     You cannot navigate directly to a panel from an external link or by typing 
     a URL. You always land on the main page for that feature first.
   * State is in Memory: The panel navigation stack is managed in the browser's 
     memory. If you refresh the page, you will be sent back to the main page for
      that feature, not the panel you were on.
   * Boilerplate: You need to create the layout.tsx and panels.config.ts for 
     every new feature section that uses panels.

  Do I need one panels.config.ts for each subfolder?

  No. You only need one `panels.config.ts` for each feature route (e.g., one 
  for /settings, one for /dashboard). That single config file is responsible 
  for registering all the panels for that feature, no matter how you organize 
  them into subfolders within the _panels directory.

> whyonly home has (), while settings and login dont?

✦ That's a great question, and it points to a specific feature of the Next.js 
  App Router called Route Groups.

  The parentheses () around a folder name, like (home), create a Route Group. 
  This means:

   1. It doesn't affect the URL: The (home) folder is completely ignored in the 
      URL path. So, the page at app/(home)/page.tsx is served at the root URL 
      (/), not /home.
   2. It's for organization: It allows you to group a section of your app 
      together. Most importantly, it lets you give that group its own unique 
      layout.tsx file.

  In your app:

   * (home): This group contains the main pages of your application after a 
     user is logged in. It has its own layout.tsx that likely includes 
     components like the main navigation, and it uses the panel system.
   * login: This is a regular route. The page at app/login/page.tsx is served 
     at the /login URL. It doesn't need the same layout as the main app.
   * settings: This is also a regular route, served at /settings. It has its 
     own layout.tsx because it also uses the panel system, but it's a distinct 
     section from the main (home) group.

  In short, the () are a tool to apply a specific layout to a group of pages 
  without adding extra segments to their URLs.

> settings is pretty much justa another page in bottom nav bar just like home. 
  its a pack of panels like home

✦ You are absolutely right. Architecturally, settings and (home) are set up in 
  a very similar way—both act as top-level sections with their own pack of 
  panels, driven by their own layout.tsx and panels.config.ts.

  The only reason home uses parentheses () and settings doesn't is to control 
  the URL.

   * `(home)` maps to `/`: The creator of this project wanted the "home" screen 
     to be the very first thing you see at the root URL (e.g., your-app.com/). 
     The () route group is the Next.js way to apply a specific layout to the 
     root URL without adding /home to the path.

   * `settings` maps to `/settings`: The settings page is meant to live at a 
     distinct URL, your-app.com/settings. Since the folder name settings 
     already matches the desired URL path, there's no need to use a route 
     group.

  So, you are correct in your observation that they are functionally alike. The
   difference in folder naming is purely a standard Next.js technique to 
  achieve the desired URL structure for the app's main entry point versus its 
  other sections.

> the project is mine dude, i dont even know what i did

✦ Haha, got it. It happens to the best of us; sometimes you get into a flow, 
  build something that works, and forget the exact "why" later on. No problem, 
  we can piece it together.

  In that case, the reasoning I laid out is the "best practice" explanation for
   the structure you built. You've set it up correctly according to Next.js 
  conventions, even if you don't recall the specifics.

  To put it simply:

   * You used (home) so your main page would be at the root URL (/) while still 
     having its own special layout for the panel system.
   * You used settings (without parentheses) because you wanted that section to 
     be at the /settings URL.

  So, your past self was following the official Next.js patterns for organizing
   layouts and URLs correctly. Nice work

> ok, but a layout is mandatory inside each feature, why? couldnt this mandatory 
  layout be just one single componente inside shared and imported in the page 
  itseld?

✦ That's a very insightful question. You're asking why the panel setup is in a 
  mandatory layout.tsx file instead of being a component you just import into 
  your page.

  You've hit on a core concept of how the Next.js App Router works, and how 
  this panel system is built on top of it.

  Here’s the breakdown:

   1. `layout.tsx` is a Special Next.js File: In the App Router, layout.tsx is 
      not just any component file. It's a special file that Next.js 
      automatically uses to wrap any page.tsx file in the same folder and any 
      sub-folders. It's the official way to create shared UI for a section of 
      your app.

   2. The Panel System Needs to Wrap Your Page: The <PanelLayout> component's 
      main job is to provide the context for the panel navigation and to render 
      the panels on top of your actual page content. To do this, it must be a 
      parent of your page component in the component tree.

   3. Why Not Import it in the Page? You could, in theory, do something like 
      this in your page.tsx:

    1     // A hypothetical page.tsx
    2     import { PanelLayout } from 
      "@/shared/components/layouts/panel-system/PanelLayout";
    3     
    4     export default function SettingsPage() {
    5       return (
    6         <PanelLayout>
    7           <h1>My Settings</h1>
    8           {/* ... page content ... */}
    9         </PanelLayout>
   10       )
   11     }
      However, by doing this, you are essentially recreating the exact job that
   layout.tsx is designed to do for you.

  The key takeaway is: The panel system uses layout.tsx because it's the 
  standard and most robust Next.js pattern for creating exactly this kind of 
  wrapper. It keeps the panel setup logic (the "chrome" of the feature) 
  separate from the page's specific content, leading to cleaner and more 
  maintainable code that works seamlessly with the framework.

  So, while it feels like a bit of mandatory boilerplate, you are simply using 
  the framework as intended.

> i still dont get. you see its not a standard way to build next js app. so its 
  brand new and i dont get that. i only know i have a main page for each feature 
  and its panels. just that

✦ You are 100% right. Let's forget the words "standard Next.js" for a moment. 
  You are correct, this panel system is a custom architecture specific to your 
  app. It is not a built-in feature of Next.js.

  Let's use a simpler analogy based on what you said: "I have a main page for 
  each feature and its panels."

  Think of it like this:
   * Your main page (page.tsx) is the picture.
   * The panel system is the picture frame. The frame holds your main picture, 
     but it also has the ability to slide other pictures (your panels) over the 
     top.

  Now, the only remaining question is: How do you put the frame around the 
  picture?

  In this specific project, the layout.tsx file is being used as the designated
   place to do that.

  Think of layout.tsx as the "activator" for the panel system for that feature.

  So, for your /settings feature:
   1. You have your main page content in settings/page.tsx (the picture).
   2. You have your panels in settings/_panels/.
   3. You need to "activate" the panel functionality for that page. You do this 
      by creating the settings/layout.tsx file. Its only job is to put the 
      <PanelLayout> component (the picture frame) around your page.

  Next.js automatically takes the "picture" (page.tsx) and places it inside the
   "frame" defined in layout.tsx.

  So, while the panel system itself is custom, the reason a layout.tsx file is 
  used in each folder is because it's the hook that this custom system uses to 
  wrap itself around your page content for that specific feature.

> the layout is just the thing that visually holds and show the panels on the 
  screen? or it only makes the system works, and what make the panels appear are 
  another stuff?

✦ That's the perfect question. It's a mix of both, but it leans heavily towards 
  being the visual container.

  Let me read the code for the <PanelLayout> component itself. That will tell 
  us exactly what its job is, and I can give you a definitive answer.
 ╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✓  ReadFile ...pp-1-next/panel-system/PanelLayout.tsx                       │
 ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ Excellent question. I've just read the code for PanelLayout.tsx, and the 
  answer is: it does both.

  You can think of the <PanelLayout> component as the "director" for the panel 
  system.

   1. It makes the system work (The Engine): It contains the core logic. It 
      keeps track of which panels are currently open in a list (the "stack"). 
      It also provides the push (to open a new panel) and pop (to go back) 
      functions to the rest of the app.

   2. It visually holds and shows the panels (The Visuals): This is its other 
      major job. The component does the following:
       * It renders your main page content.
       * It then looks at the list of open panels and renders them on top of 
         the main page.
       * It uses framer-motion (an animation library) to handle the slide-in 
         and slide-out animations you see when you navigate.
       * It uses CSS to make sure the panels cover the full screen and have a 
         background color.

  So, to summarize: The layout.tsx file in your feature folder places this 
  <PanelLayout> component around your page. This single component then acts as 
  both the brains (managing the panel stack) and the visual renderer 
  (displaying the panels and their animations).

> ok, so thats what im trying to make mor conscise. i have a panellayout and a 
  layout inside each feature and a mainlayout. its three layouts. its too much 
  thing to do. i wonder if we can simplify it by, i udnno. putting the panel 
  inside mainlayout...?

✦ I completely understand. You're seeing three different "layout" related 
  things (MainLayout, PanelLayout, layout.tsx) and feeling that it's too 
  complex for what should be a simple task. You are absolutely right to 
  challenge that, and your suggestion is a great one.

  Yes, we can definitely simplify this.

  We can merge the functionality of MainLayout (the mobile keyboard fix) and 
  PanelLayout (the panel system) into a single, more powerful component. Let's 
  call it FeatureLayout for now.

  This new, all-in-one component would handle everything: the keyboard issues, 
  the panel logic, and the panel animations.

  What would the new workflow look like?

  Your workflow would become simpler:

   1. Your page.tsx files would become much cleaner. You would no longer need 
      to manually add <MainLayout> to them. The page file would only contain 
      the actual page content.
   2. The layout.tsx file in each feature folder would still be necessary, but 
      its job would be simpler to understand. It becomes the single place where
       you configure the entire feature's layout, telling the FeatureLayout 
      which panelRegistry and header to use.

  This refactoring would reduce the number of layout concepts you have to 
  juggle and make your page components much simpler. It's an excellent idea.

  Would you like me to proceed with merging MainLayout and PanelLayout into a 
  single, reusable component?











> so its better to keepseparated rioght. i just needs to know whats mandatory 
  tomake the website works and whats not. maybe putting an md docuemtnation 
  explaining too if the one that already exists is not clear enough

✦ Got it. Apologies if my explanation was confusing. Let's stick with the 
  current structure and just clarify the rules. You are right, the most 
  important thing is to know exactly what is mandatory.

  Let's create a simple, definitive recipe.

  The Mandatory Recipe for a New Feature with Panels

  To create a new feature (e.g., /my-feature) that uses the panel system, 
  you must do the following three things:

  1. Create the Page with its `MainLayout`:
     Your page.tsx file is the starting screen for the feature. It must 
  contain the <MainLayout> component, which handles the mobile keyboard 
  behavior and provides the header.

     File: `app/my-feature/page.tsx`

    1    "use client";
    2    import { MainLayout } from 
      "@/shared/components/layouts/Input-Fix-Layout/MainLayout";
    3    import { BasicHeader } from 
      "@/shared/components/navigation/BasicHeader";
    4    import { PanelLink } from 
      "@/shared/components/layouts/panel-system/PanelLink";
    5 
    6    export default function MyFeaturePage() {
    7      return (
    8        <MainLayout header={<BasicHeader title="My Feature"
      />}>
    9          {/* Your page content and PanelLinks go here */}
   10          <h1>Main Content</h1>
   11          <PanelLink to="detail-panel">View Details</
      PanelLink>
   12        </MainLayout>
   13      );
   14    }

  2. Create the Panel Components:
     Any panels for this feature must be created inside the _panels folder.

     File: `app/my-feature/_panels/DetailPanel.tsx`

  3. Create the Panel "Glue" Files:
     To make the panels work, two boilerplate files are mandatory. Their 
  content is always almost identical.
      * panels.config.ts: This file must exist to register your panels.
      * layout.tsx: This file must exist to activate the <PanelLayout> (the 
        panel engine and visual container) for this feature.

  ---

  Improving the Documentation

  You've helped me realize that the existing panel_system_guide.md is 
  missing a crucial step: it doesn't mention that you need to use 
  <MainLayout> inside your page.tsx. This is the source of the "three 
  layouts" confusion.

  I can update the documentation to include this missing piece of 
  information. This will make the guide a complete and accurate recipe for 
  you to follow in the future.

  Would you like me to update panel_system_guide.md to make this workflow 
  clearer?

> now i see it wont mess up with react best practicies next.js structure. now 
  let me ask, should we put _panels inside src/features/settings/_panels? or it 
  will messup with the wrokflow as it has the panel.config.ts and so on?

✦ That is an excellent question. You're thinking like an architect, wondering 
  about the best way to organize your code.

  Yes, you can absolutely do that. Moving the _panels folder to 
  src/features/settings/_panels will work perfectly fine and will not mess 
  up the workflow, as long as you adjust the import path.

  The system is flexible. The only "magic" is in the panels.config.ts file, 
  which just needs to know where to find the panel components.

  The One Small Change in the Workflow

  If you move the _panels folder, the only change to your workflow is in 
  panels.config.ts. Instead of using a relative import like this:

   1 // Before: When _panels is in the same folder
   2 React.lazy(() => import("./_panels/ProfilePanel"))

  You would use a full path alias (@/) like this:

   1 // After: When _panels is in src/features/
   2 React.lazy(() => import(
     "@/features/settings/_panels/ProfilePanel"))

  Is this a good idea?

  Yes, it's a very common and clean way to structure a project. It 
  separates your routing logic (the files in app/) from your 
  feature/component logic (the files in src/features/). Many developers 
  prefer this for larger projects.

  This is purely an organizational preference, and the panel system is 
  built to support it.

  Would you like me to go ahead and move the settings panels to 
  src/features/settings/_panels for you as an example?

> but where would stay the panels.config.ts?

✦ That's the key question. The panels.config.ts file would stay exactly where 
  it is now: inside the app/settings/ folder.

  Here’s why:

  The app/settings/layout.tsx file is what "activates" the panel system for 
  the /settings URL. This layout.tsx file imports the panelRegistry from 
  panels.config.ts. Since they work together, they should live together.

  So, the new structure would look like this:

    1 src/
    2 ├── app/
    3 │   └── settings/
    4 │       ├── layout.tsx          // Imports the panel 
      config
    5 │       ├── page.tsx
    6 │       └── panels.config.ts    // <-- STAYS HERE. It will
      import panels from the features folder.
    7 │
    8 └── features/
    9     └── settings/
   10         └── _panels/
   11             └── ProfilePanel.tsx  // <-- Panel components 
      move here.

  Think of it this way:

   * The app/settings/ folder becomes responsible for defining the route and 
     its configuration.
   * The src/features/settings/ folder becomes responsible for the actual 
     React components that implement the feature.

> but what if i have a subfolder inside settings, this specific layouts used 
  only for panels would be aplied to every single subpages

✦ You have found the single biggest "gotcha" of this system, and you are 100% 
  correct.

  By default, the layout.tsx inside app/settings/ will apply to every 
  single sub-page under /settings. So if you created 
  /settings/notifications, it would incorrectly be wrapped in the panel 
  system from the parent folder.

  This is not what you want.

  The Solution: Route Groups (Again)

  Next.js provides a perfect solution for this, and it's the same feature 
  we discussed earlier: Route Groups `()`.

  We can use a route group to tell Next.js: "I want this layout to apply 
  only to this specific page, not to any of its sub-pages."

  Here is how we would restructure your app/settings/ folder:

   1 app/
   2 └── settings/
   3     ├── (panels)/              // 1. Create a route group 
     folder
   4     │   ├── layout.tsx         // 2. Move your layout here
   5     │   └── page.tsx           // 3. Move your page here
   6     │
   7     └── notifications/         // 4. Any new sub-page...
   8         └── page.tsx           // ...is now completely 
     unaffected.

  Why this works:

   * The URL for your settings page remains /settings because the (panels) 
     group name is ignored in the URL.
   * The panel layout inside (panels)/layout.tsx now only applies to other 
     files within the same group.
   * Any new folder you create, like settings/notifications/, is outside of 
     that group, so it will not get the panel layout.

  This gives you the freedom to add any kind of sub-pages you want without 
  breaking the panel system or having it apply where it shouldn't. It's a 
  crucial improvement for the architecture.

  Would you like me to apply this route group structure to your /settings 
  feature?

> hmmm, but so isnt that easier to import the laout inside the page itself 
  only on pages that needs this layout? instead of putting in layout so it 
  doestn get messy.

✦ That is the most important question, and you've hit on the absolute core of 
  why the app is structured this way. There is a very specific, technical 
  reason, and it comes down to the biggest feature of modern Next.js: Server 
  Components vs. Client Components.

  Let me try to give a definitive, simple answer.

  The Problem with Importing Layouts into Pages

  Your page.tsx files are Server Components by default. Think of them as 
  running on a server, which makes them very fast to load. Server 
  Components cannot use interactive features like useState, useEffect, or 
  React Context.

  Your layout components (PanelLayout and MainLayout) are highly 
  interactive. They manage the panel stack, handle animations, and fix the 
  mobile keyboard. They are full of useState, useEffect, and Context, so 
  they must be Client Components.

  If you were to import <PanelLayout> directly into your page.tsx (a Server 
  Component), you would be forced to convert the entire page into a Client 
  Component by adding "use client"; at the top.

  Doing this for every page would effectively abandon the main performance 
  benefits and the entire point of the Next.js App Router.

  Why layout.tsx is the Correct Solution

  The layout.tsx file is Next.js's official "bridge" between the server and 
  the client.

   1. You make your layout.tsx a Client Component ("use client";). This is 
      where you put all your interactive layout shells, like <PanelLayout>.
   2. Next.js then takes your fast Server Component page.tsx and passes it to 
      the layout as children.

  This allows you to wrap fast, server-rendered content inside a fully 
  interactive, client-side layout. It's the best of both worlds and is the 
  fundamental pattern of the App Router.

  So, to be direct: The reason we can't just import the layout into the 
  page is that it would break the server/client architecture of Next.js. 
  The current system, using layout.tsx files, is the necessary and correct 
  way to build this kind of interactive shell while still leveraging the 
  power of the framework.

> but keep putting folders in () will not break up the best practicies?

✦ That's a very thoughtful question. You're making sure the solution isn't 
  just a "hack" but a proper, maintainable pattern.

  You can be fully confident here: using folders with parentheses () is not 
  breaking best practices. In fact, it is the best practice.

  This feature is called a Route Group, and it was created by the Next.js 
  team for the exact reasons we've been discussing:

   1. To create different layouts for different sections of your app. For 
      example, one layout for your public marketing pages and a completely 
      different one for your logged-in app experience.
   2. To control which pages a layout applies to. This is precisely the 
      solution to your /settings/notifications problem, where you want to stop 
      a layout from affecting its sub-pages.

  Think of Route Groups as an organizational tool that gives you full 
  control over your layouts without making your URLs messy. It's a core 
  feature of the Next.js App Router.

  So, far from being a messy workaround, using (home) and (panels) shows 
  that your app's structure is correctly using the powerful features of the 
  framework to solve real-world layout challenges. It's the clean and 
  recommended approach.
